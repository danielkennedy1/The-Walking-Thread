## Running the program
- Navigate to Main.java file in server package: "src/server/Main.java"
- Run the server's main class. This creates the server which will continue to run
- Navigate to Main.java file in client package: "src/client/Main.java"
- Run the client's main class. This creates a client and connection to the server

## Executing commands
- Once the client is connected to the server, you will be prompted to enter your name is the console. 
- Once your name is entered, you can submit chats or commands which will be sent to the server
- The "/help" command will print a list of commands available and a brief description of their functionality
- Sample commands to try:
-  /quote : gives a quote and its author
-  /question : asks a computer science related question
-  /answer : gives the answer of the previously asked question
-  /joke : tells a funny dad joke

## Logger.txt
- The logger.txt file holds logs for all the messages sent to the server.
- This file takes details such as the address of the client, the sender name/ command type and the time of the message and logs it. 
- Note: to refresh the content of the logger file, you may need to click out and back into the file.
